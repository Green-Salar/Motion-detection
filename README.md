# Motion-detection
I am working working on motion detection to find a new way of finding velocity of objects particles or any thing that will come to my mind in a flow or a moving area. It is a try to became familiar and try to invent new way of finding velocity in a flow field. this project will be helpfull in our labratories.
I have used 2 different method - parse method and dense method.
